## Course description

This seminar provides a gentle, hands-on introduction to the essential tools for quantitative research for students of the humanities. During the course of the seminar, the students will familiarize themselves with a wide array of software that is rarely taught but is invaluable in developing an efficient, transparent, reusable, and scalable research workflow. From text file, through data visualization, to creating beautiful reports - this course will empower students to improve their skill and help them establish good practices.

The seminar is targeted at students with little to no experience with programming, who wish to improve their workflow, learn the basics of data handling and document typesetting, prepare for a big project (such as a BA or MA thesis), and learn about scientific project management.

Materials: laptop with internet access
